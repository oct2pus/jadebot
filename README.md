# Jadebot

Jadebot is a discordbot aimed at homestuck servers, she primarily has 4 commands:

- **MSPA**/**BOORU** searches the mspabooru for images, it has a locked blacklist to keep the content safe for work.

- **DOG** searches dog.ceo for images of dogs, use **DOGE** to find shibi specifically!

- **OTP**/**SHIP** determines how canon something is.

- **WIKI** provides both a link to and a short summary of content from the MSPA wikia.
