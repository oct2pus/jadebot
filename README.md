# Jadebot

Jadebot is a discordbot aimed at homestuck servers, she primarily has 3 commands:


**MSPA**/**BOORU** searches the mspabooru for images, it has a locked blacklist to keep the content safe for work.

**DOG** searches dog.ceo for images of dogs, use **DOGE** to find shibi specifically!

**OTP**/**SHIP** determines how canon something is.

Wiki will be reimplimented shortly, but will provide both a link to and a short summary of content from the MSPA wiki.

## Where are all the old commands?

When i rewrote Jadebot I decided to cut the cruft and focus on what specifically makes her Jadebot, originally i was only going to reimpliment MSPA, DOG, and WIKI but people really, really missed OTP so I added that as well.
