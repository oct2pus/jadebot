# Jadebot

Jadebot is a discordbot aimed at homestuck servers, she has 4 primary commands:

- **MSPA**/**BOORU** searches the mspabooru for images, it has a locked blacklist to keep the content safe for work.

- **DOG** searches dog.ceo for images of dogs, use **DOGE** to find shibi specifically!

- **OTP**/**SHIP** determines how canon something is.

- **WIKI** provides both a link to and a short summary of content from the MSPA wikia.

## Design
The original Jadebot design was based upon the canonical Jadebot from Homestuck, modified to be more human-like and with some other minor aesthetic changes.
[Jadebot's design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oct2pus/jadebot/origin/art/reference_sheet.png) was thought up by me and interpretted by [taiyoooh](taiyoooh.tumblr.com) and later modified and formalized the help of [mupparts](https://mupparts.tumblr.com). Please feel free to reuse the design/draw fanart!
