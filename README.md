# Jadebot

Jadebot is a discordbot aimed at homestuck servers, she has **3** primary commands:

- **MSPA**/**BOORU** searches the mspabooru for images, it has a locked blacklist to keep the content safe for work.

- **DOG** searches dog.ceo for images of dogs, use **DOGE** to find shibi specifically!

- **WIKI** provides both a link to and a short summary of content from the MSPA wikia.

## Design
[Jadebot's design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oct2pus/jadebot/origin/art/reference_sheet.png) is an adaption of [Jade's Dreambot](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Robotics#Jade.27s_Dreambot) from the webcomic [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/), adapted to more resemble Jade Harley's 20-something self as well as being more emotive. originally drawn by [taiyoooh](taiyoooh.tumblr.com) and later modified and formalized the help of [mupparts](https://mupparts.tumblr.com). Please feel free to reuse the design/draw fanart!
